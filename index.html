      <h2>The best marketing is when you don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s marketing.</h2>

      <p>Marketing today is defined by how useful it is to your customers. And the bar of what&rsquo;s useful has risen substantially. Where blog posts, infographics, and webinars were once marketing gold, websites, apps, and tools are taking over.</p>

      <p>If you&rsquo;re trying to get a new idea off the ground, you must aim to create extreme value with your marketing. This is the only way to cut through the clutter of today.</p>

      <p><a href="">Our company, Crew, doubled its revenue every year for three years</a>, mainly from building tools that create value. It worked for us. And with the help of some awesome folks we&rsquo;re going to teach you everything we know.</p>
